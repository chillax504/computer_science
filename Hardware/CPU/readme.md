### [ALU](#alu)
An Arithmetic and Logical Unit is a highly developed integrated circuit or IC. It can perform Arithmetic operation(such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and divsion) and logical boolean operations(such as XOR, AND, NOR etc.). Generally, the ALU takes takes the input of operands and an operation code(OPCODE) and gives an ouput of a status and a result.

### [Register](#register)
A Register is memory unit of very limitted capacity. Their function is to provide and recieve data from the ALU. The data here is obtained from the main memory of a computer.

### [Contrul Unit](#contrul-unit)
This unit in a processor controls all the data traffic. It's function is to control the flow of instructions and to obtain the data from the main memory that has to be passed to the register. It is also an interpreter of issues, instructions and signals
